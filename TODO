TODOS
=====

1. Fix retargeting of POW, consider ignoring blocks with no POW so that - after breaks - the target value is not minimal 
again
2. Set minimal XEL_PER_POW correctly
3. Raise the VM memory from 256 to a HIGH value
4. Make sure pruned source code does not collide with POW, i.e., work deadline must be before pruning starts --- also check if I did it correct in validateAttachment in TransactionType.java for POW and Bounty!
5. ENSURE minimal pruning height by protocol
